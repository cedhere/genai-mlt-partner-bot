## MLT Gen AI Project

## Introduction
As part of the MLT Career Prep '27 cohort, I had the opportunity to expand my technical skills by building this project. Beyond learning the technologies listed in the tech stack below, I also developed experience with the full software development lifecycle — including project planning, meeting deadlines, code deployment, and overall project management.


## What is the SEC & Its Use in This Project

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the federal government agency that regulates the securities markets in the United States. Its mission is to protect investors, maintain fair and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation — essentially acting as the referee of the stock market.

Public companies such as NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft are required to regularly submit financial reports to the SEC. These reports are stored in a large public database called **EDGAR**, which is the foundation of this project.

This project provides tools to pull and organize those reports so developers, investors, and analysts can access them quickly. Instead of manually digging through EDGAR, users can use this software to look up companies and grab their filings in a structured way.

The main reports supported are:
- **10-K (Annual Report)** — a company’s most detailed yearly filing.  
- **10-Q (Quarterly Report)** — shorter updates released throughout the year.
